faq:
- question: Can I upgrade from the starter plan to the pro plan?
  answer: Yes.
- question: Can users run images from docker hub or push their own images to the registry?
  answer: Yes, but with a few caveats. For security reasons, no images that run processes
    as root are allowed. Additionally, any Dockerfile VOLUME instruction must be mounted
    with either a persistent volume claim (PVC) or an EmptyDir at this time.
- question: What databases are supported?
  answer: The Digital Garage currently supports MariaDB (10.1), MongoDB (2.6, 3.2),
    MySQL (5.6, 5.7), PostgreSQL (9.4, 9.5), and Redis (3.2).
- question: Can I Run Production Applications on The Digital Garage?
  answer: 'Yes. The Digital Garage does not limit your applications to development
    workloads. Please read the Service Level Agreement carefully to determine if The
    Digital Garage, Inc. Service Level Agreement is sufficient for your production
    application. Please contact us for a Production Service Level Agreement if our
    standard agreement does not fit your needs. '
- question: What languages and datastores are supported?
  answer: The Digital Garage currently supports Java (8), .NET Core (1.0, 1.1, 2.0),
    Node.js (4, 6), Python (2.7, 3.4, 3.5), Ruby (2.2, 2.3, 2.4), and Perl (5.20,
    5.24). Jenkins (2.x), Prometheus and Jeager are also available for CI/CD. Supported
    Quickstart application templates are available for Apache HTTP Server, NGINX,
    Django, Node.js, and Ruby on Rails.
- question: Can I change my plan at a later time?
  answer: Yes, you can upgrade and downgrade your plan at anytime.
